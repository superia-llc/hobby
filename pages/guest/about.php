   			<p>The FIRMD Vacation House was founded in 1988 by Marcelino T. Bandong and his wife Regina Z. Bandong at age 32 and 36 respectively. Given Mr. Bandong’s background as an accountant and manager in Shaparal Inn and Mrs. Bandong’s background as a supervisor in Krismar Mansion Hotel, they worked together to set up their business.
			<br><br>The vacation house was originally built with just one unit consisting of three bedrooms. The couple expanded the business, through bank installments, by building additional units every 2 years.
			<br><br>When the vacation house reached its 5th unit, they started to hire housekeeping staff. They also hired agents whose job was to advertise FIRMD Vacation House to tourists visiting Baguio.
			<br><br>At present (2017), the vacation house is composed of 12 units with a total of 30 bedrooms.
